#  ML Models From Scratch

A curated collection of **machine learning models implemented from scratch** in Python. The focus is on understanding the **math and algorithms** behind each model rather than relying on high-level libraries.  

Currently, this repository includes a **Micrograd extension**, building a modular neural network engine from scratch.

##  Features

### Micrograd Extension
- Inspired by Andrej Karpathy’s [Micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd)
- Fully modular neural network engine
- Trainable layers with autograd support
- Forward and backward propagation from scratch
- Gradient-based optimization for custom models
- Designed for experimentation and learning

### Linear Regression
Implemented a Linear Regression model from scratch in Python using 
manual gradient descent,
feature scaling,
and loss computation
to predict housing prices. 
Compared performance against scikit-learn’s LinearRegression, Ridge, and Lasso models. 
Built custom normalization, standardization, and Mean Squared Error functions, 
visualized loss convergence, and benchmarked results on the Housing dataset.
