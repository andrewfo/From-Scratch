#  ML Models From Scratch

A curated collection of **machine learning models implemented from scratch** in Python. The focus is on understanding the **math and algorithms** behind each model rather than relying on high-level libraries.  

Currently, this repository includes a **Micrograd extension**, building a modular neural network engine from scratch.

##  Features

### Micrograd Extension
- Inspired by Andrej Karpathyâ€™s [Micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd)
- Fully modular neural network engine
- Trainable layers with autograd support
- Forward and backward propagation from scratch
- Gradient-based optimization for custom models
- Designed for experimentation and learning
